# ADR-001: Technology Stack Selection

**Status**: Accepted

**Date**: 2024-01-01

**Deciders**: Development Team, Tech Lead

**Tags**: architecture, technology, stack, initial-setup

---

## Context

We need to select a technology stack for our new web application that:
- Enables rapid AI-assisted development with Cursor
- Provides excellent developer experience
- Supports modern web development practices
- Scales effectively for production workloads
- Integrates well with AI development workflows

## Decision

We will use the following technology stack:

### Frontend
- **Next.js 14+** with App Router
- **TypeScript** in strict mode
- **Tailwind CSS v4** for styling
- **React 18+** for UI components

### Backend
- **Next.js API Routes** for serverless endpoints
- **Server Actions** for server-side mutations

### Database
- **Neon Postgres** for cloud-native database
- **Prisma** as the ORM and query builder

### Testing
- **Jest** for unit and integration tests
- **React Testing Library** for component tests
- **Playwright** for end-to-end tests

### Tooling
- **ESLint** + **Prettier** for code quality
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD
- **Vercel** for hosting and deployment

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind (Chosen)

**Pros**:
- Best-in-class developer experience
- Excellent AI tool support (Cursor, Copilot)
- Strong type safety with TypeScript
- Rapid UI development with Tailwind
- Serverless architecture reduces ops overhead
- Vercel deployment is seamless
- Large ecosystem and community

**Cons**:
- Vendor lock-in with Vercel (partially mitigated by Next.js portability)
- Learning curve for App Router (new paradigm)
- Tailwind requires different mental model

### Option 2: Remix + TypeScript + CSS Modules

**Pros**:
- Modern web standards approach
- Excellent form handling
- Progressive enhancement built-in
- No vendor lock-in

**Cons**:
- Smaller ecosystem than Next.js
- Less AI tool optimization
- More manual configuration required
- Newer framework with fewer resources

### Option 3: Create React App + Express + TypeScript

**Pros**:
- Complete control over architecture
- Well-understood patterns
- Can deploy anywhere

**Cons**:
- Much more boilerplate
- Have to build tooling ourselves
- Slower development velocity
- Poor AI-assisted development support
- CRA is no longer actively maintained

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind**, because:

1. **AI-First Development**: Next.js is heavily optimized for AI code generation tools like Cursor, with excellent TypeScript inference and component patterns that AI understands well

2. **Developer Productivity**: The combination provides the fastest path from requirements to working application, which is critical for AI-assisted development workflows

3. **Type Safety**: TypeScript strict mode catches errors at compile time, reducing the AI-generated code review burden

4. **Modern Architecture**: App Router and Server Components represent the future of React development

5. **Ecosystem Maturity**: Large community, extensive documentation, and AI training data mean better code generation results

### Positive Consequences

- Rapid development velocity with AI assistance
- Strong type safety reduces runtime errors
- Excellent performance out of the box
- Seamless deployment workflow
- Rich ecosystem of compatible libraries
- Active development and regular updates

### Negative Consequences

- Some Vercel-specific features create soft vendor lock-in
- App Router is newer and has fewer resources than Pages Router
- Tailwind requires team buy-in and learning
- Serverless architecture has cold start implications
- Need to monitor Vercel costs as traffic scales

### Implementation Notes

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - Use `create-next-app` with TypeScript template
   - Configure Tailwind v4 (latest beta)
   - Set up Prisma with Neon Postgres
   - Configure ESLint and Prettier

2. **Testing Setup**:
   - Configure Jest with TypeScript
   - Set up React Testing Library
   - Install and configure Playwright
   - Set coverage threshold to ≥90%

3. **CI/CD Setup**:
   - Configure GitHub Actions workflows
   - Set up automated testing
   - Enable CodeQL security scanning
   - Configure Vercel preview deployments

4. **Timeline**:
   - Week 1: Bootstrap application with chosen stack
   - Week 2: Set up CI/CD and testing infrastructure
   - Ongoing: Validate decisions as we build features

## Validation

### Success Metrics
- Development velocity: Can implement features in <5 days from requirements to production
- Code quality: Maintain ≥90% test coverage
- AI effectiveness: ≥80% of code generated by AI with minimal human intervention
- Performance: Page load <2s, API response <100ms
- Developer satisfaction: Team feedback positive after 3 months

### Review Date
- **3 months** from implementation
- **6 months** for comprehensive review
- Re-evaluate if major issues arise

**Implementation Status**: ✅ Complete

**Notes**:
- This ADR establishes the foundational technology decisions for the project
- Future ADRs should reference this when making related technology choices
- If we discover significant issues, we'll create a new ADR rather than modifying this one
